### **About the app**

The objective of this R Shiny application and the accompanying summary report is to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of climate variations in British Columbia (BC) and its sub-regions when compared to long-term average for monthly, seasonal and annual data. This tool is designed to offer users valuable insights into how the climate has evolved over the course of several decades. Furthermore, this application is updated on a monthly basis and offers recent climate change information lagged by approximately two weeks.

The application serves as a valuable resource by presenting anomalies of the fundamental climate parameters, specifically air temperature (minimum, maximum, and mean) and total precipitation. Users have the flexibility to select any of these climate parameters to observe spatial and temporal changes that have occurred in their chosen region.This app generates maps displaying chosen parameters for selected year(s) and month/season within the specified region. Users can save the maps/plots generated by the application, obtain the full report in HTML format and download associated data.

This app, by offering interactive maps, trend analysis, and downloadable capabilities, serve as a resources for anyone interested in gaining insights into the evolving climate of BC and its sub-regions over the past several decades.

**Anomaly App** page present the spatial anomalies for the selected region, parameter and years. It also provide an overview of average, minimum, and maximum anomalies within the specified region and period. Similarly, this page generates time series plot of the anomalies for selected region, and parameter for the period of 1950 to present year.
Users have option to download the map, plot and data associated with them.

### **Download data and plot**

By clicking *Download plot* button one can save the plots. The plot will be saved with name *REGION_PARAMETER_MONTH_SELECTED START YEAR_SELECTED END YEAR_spatial_anomaly_plt.png* for spatial anomaly maps and *REGION_PARAMETER_MONTH_1951_2023_spatial_averaged_trend.png* for spatially averaged trend plot. The trend magnitude and *p*-value are embedded within the time series plot. 

*Download raster data* button downloads the spatial anomaly data in *GTiff* format for the selected region and period with each band having data for one year. The downloaded file will named *REGION_PARAMETER_MONTH_SELECTED START YEAR_SELECTED END YEAR_spatial_anomaly_data.tif*. Similarly *Download anomaly time series data* button download spatially averaged time series of selected parameter for the selected region. The data start in 1950 and available upto recent month. The downloaded *csv* file is named as *REGION_PARAMETER_MONTH_19510_2023_spatiallyaveraged_anomaly_time series.csv* and have four columns namely *yr*,*anew* for anomalies values, *par* for parameter, *Mon* for month and *region* for name of the region. If the climate parameter is *tmean*, *tmax* or *tmin* the unit of the anomalies is **Â°C** and if the parameter is *prcp* the unit is **% of normal**. 

*Climate Normal* indicates average climatology (1981-2010) of the selected parameter. It also shows mean value and range of the anomaly.

**Report**  provides a comprehensive summary of anomalies, including a general overview spanning from 1980 to 2022 and month-to-month summaries for recent months.


### **Data and methods**

The goal of this shiny app and the summary report is to help users understand how climate parameters have changed from long term average at monthly, seasonal and annual level in BC and sub regions. To achieve this, we use <a href='https://cds.climate.Copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/data set/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview'> ERA5-Land hourly data</a> from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5). The ERA5-Land is a reanalysis gridded data set developed combining model and observed data and is available at about 9 km by 9 km spatial and hourly temporal resolution.

We calculate the anomaly of the variable relative to the climatological normal of 1981-2010, where the climatological normal is the long term average of the same variable. An anomaly for particular year or month is calculated by subtracting the climatological mean of the variable. We regridded the data to spatial resolution of about 30 km by 30 km.

We perform the Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen trend estimate that yield the significance and magnitude of the trend, for the period of 1950 to recent year and 1980- to recent year, respectively.
