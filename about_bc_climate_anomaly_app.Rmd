### **About the app**

### ***Background***
The BC climate anomaly app, developed as an R Shiny application, along with accompanying summary report, aims to provide a comprehensive insight into climate variations within British Columbia (BC) and its sub-regions. This tool facilitates the comparison of climate data against long-term averages, offering users valuable insights into the evolution of climate patterns over several decades. The application is consistently updated on a monthly basis, providing climate change information with a lag of approximately two weeks.

### ***Key Features***

This application serves as a valuable resource by presenting anomalies of fundamental climate parameters, specifically air temperature (minimum, maximum, and mean) and total precipitation. Users have the flexibility to select any of these climate parameters to observe spatial and temporal changes within their chosen region. The app generates maps that display the selected parameters for specific years and months/seasons within the specified region. Users can save these maps and plots generated by the application, obtain the full report in HTML format, and download associated data.
Resource for Insight

The Climate BC app, with its interactive maps, trend analysis, and downloadable capabilities, serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in gaining insights into the evolving climate of BC and its sub-regions over the past several decades.

### ***Anomaly App page***

The *Anomaly App* page, as a main application, presents the spatial anomalies maps, time series and trend of the anomalies, climate normal map and anomalies overview of the selected parameters for chosen period, months/seasons and region. The overview table shows average, minimum, and maximum anomalies within the specified region and period. Similarly, this page generates *time series* plots of anomalies for the selected region and parameter, spanning from 1950 to the present year. Additionally, it displays spatial plots of *climate normal*, indicating the average climatology (1981-2010) of the selected parameter. The climate normal map also shows the mean value and range of the anomaly. Users have the option to download maps, plots, and associated data.

### ***Download data and plot***

By clicking the *Download Plot* button, users can save the plots with names that include the *region*, *parameter*, and *start and end years (or years of climate normal)* in *.PNG* format.
The *Download Raster Data* button allows users to download spatial anomaly data and climate normal data in *GTiff* format for the selected region and period, with each band containing data for one year. The *Download anomaly time series data* button download spatially averaged time series of selected parameter anomalies for the chosen region in *.csv* format. The dataset includes four columns: year (*yr*), anomalies values (*ano*), parameter (*par*), month (*Mon*), and *region* (name of the region). If the climate parameter is temperature-related (tmean, tmax, or tmin), the anomalies are in **°C** degrees Celsius **(°C)**, and if the parameter is precipitation (prcp), the unit is a percentage of normal **(% of normal)**.

**Report**  provides a comprehensive summary of anomalies, including a general overview spanning from 1980 to 2022 and month-to-month summaries for recent months.


### ***Data and methods***

The goal of this shiny app and the summary report is to help users understand how climate parameters have changed from long term average at monthly, seasonal and annual level in BC and sub regions. To achieve this, we use <a href='https://cds.climate.Copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/data set/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview'> ERA5-Land hourly data</a> from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5). The ERA5-Land is a reanalysis gridded data set developed combining model and observed data and is available at about 9 km by 9 km spatial and hourly temporal resolution.

We calculate the anomaly of the variable relative to the climatological normal of 1981-2010, where the climatological normal is the long term average of the same variable. An anomaly for particular year or month is calculated by subtracting the climatological mean of the variable. We regridded the data to spatial resolution of about 30 km by 30 km.

We perform the Mann-Kendall test and the Theil-Sen trend estimate that yield the significance and magnitude of the trend, for the period of 1950 to present year and 1980- to present year, respectively.
